# Nabu
Nabu was the ancient Babylonian of writing and Scribing. Nabu is an application that helps dev team compile the various APIs they use/create and be able to view the various endpoints of these APIs in a swagger UI format, enabling for simple and easy documentation.

## What does Nabu do

* Contains a basic auth setup, so that page views are restricted to those who have team credentials. (The admin will set the username and password)

* Stores the path and token of the API when added to the list, removing the need to repeatedly enter these credentials to access the documentation.

* Provides API documentation in a clear and interactive format.(using SwaggerUi)

## What Nabu needs
* Any API included must have an associated Swagger file.

* A PostgresDB (Installation instructions included.)
